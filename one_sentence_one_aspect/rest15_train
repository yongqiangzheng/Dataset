We were seated outside and the $T$ spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date .

One would think we 'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby $T$ would n't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .

With so many good restaurants on the UWS , I do n't need overpriced $T$ , absurdly arrogant wait - staff who do n't recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management that does n't care .
