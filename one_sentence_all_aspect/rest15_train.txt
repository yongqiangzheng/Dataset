the pasta penne was pretty extra buttery , creamy which means a big task to diggest ... tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count , penne ... got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed ... lol

over the years the host , vittorio , and his crew , have always treated me as family -- although with all the business this not - so - little gem does , it amazing he 's even able to remember a consistent but not - so - frequent visitor .

i 've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years : a new jazz bar , the most fantastic dining garden , the best thin crust pizzas , and now a lasagna menu which is to die for -LRB- these are not your average lasagnas -RRB- !
