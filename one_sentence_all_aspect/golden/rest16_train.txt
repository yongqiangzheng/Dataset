at first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint , but at bark you do n't just get your average hot dog .

cool atmosphere , the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night .

there is no way it justifies the accolades it receives , the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table .

mistakes happen , but they are usually accompanied by an apology , perhaps even a glass of wine ... but not the grunt that we received from the al di la staff .

the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating -LRB- a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it -RRB- .
