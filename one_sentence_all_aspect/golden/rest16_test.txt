the pancakes were certainly inventive but $ 8.50 for 3 - 6 " pancakes -LRB- one of them was more like 5 " -RRB- in the pancake flight -LRB- sample of 3 different pancakes -RRB- is well over - priced .

the pancakes should be larger -LRB- at least 8 " -RRB- to justify the expense even with the unique offerings .

on my meal i had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking , and would have had to send them back again if i had n't rejected the meal all together .

i rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and i was too frustrated to continue .

to their credit they removed the dish from the check ; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was .

ray 's is something of a seattle institution , but given its gorgeous sound views , i had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service .

my party of two was feeling particularly ambitious , and we splurged on the shilshole sampler ... a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns , smoked albacore tuna , ray 's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill , scallops in a tasty soy dressing , and a tiny pile of dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce .

our server continued to be attentive throughout the night , but i did remain puzzled by one issue : who thinks that ray 's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner ?
